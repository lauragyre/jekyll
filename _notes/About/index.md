I'm Laura Gyre. 

I'm a compulsive reader, a [[Writing|writer]], [[Illustration|illustrator]], and [[Web Development|web developer]], and a part-time [[Education|alternative educator]]. I have a deep and abiding interest in the power of metaphor, as applied on both [[Analysis and Synthesis|logical]] and [[Intuition|intuitive]] levels. Another major passion at the moment is [[Greek Philosophy|Greek]] [[Philosophy|philosophy]], which I've been finding connects to all of the above in curious ways! Specifically, I'm increasingly interested in the [[Metaphor and Magic|deep, magical understanding of the use of metaphor]] that seems to have been embeded in the [[Platonism|Platonic]] current throughout history, which I feel hasn't been sufficiently explored or appreciated in a lot of academic work on related subjects (and, on the other hand, hasn't been sufficiently researched and documented by occultists). 

On a personal level, I'm also pretty interested in [[Habits Live in the Environment|habit design]] with a heavy emphasis on [[Creativity|creative]] and [[Spirituality|magical/spiritual]] praxis, and I think quite a bit about [[Holistic Health|holistic health]].
