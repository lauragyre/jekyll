Get a notebook and start writing compulsively. Write often about whatever you think and experience, with as little internal editing as possible.

Read The Four Agreements. Read The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up and get rid of half your stuff if you have a lot of stuff (yes, including books). Read or listen to the audiobook How to Meditate by Pema Chodron. Try the Insight Timer app if you like that sort of thing.

Every day, find things to feel grateful for. Write about them in your notebook.

When you encounter challenges, mysteries or uncomfortable things, draw a picture of how you feel and give it a title.

Read Plant Intelligence and the Imaginal Realm, even if you're not really that into plants. Read the Dreaming Source of Creativity even if you're not that into creativity. Read Emergent Strategy: Shaping Change, Changing Worlds, especially if you do organizing work, and Unconditional Parenting if you have kids. Read Belonging by Toko-pa Turner.

Think more about your dreams. Light candles for your burning desires. Occasionally, do things that terrify you.

Read Rock the Boat: How to Use Conflict to Heal and Deepen Relationship and Sitting in the Fire: Large Group Transformation Using Conflict and Diversity. Listen to Brene Brown's TED talk on vulnerability, with the understanding that vulnerability isn't always a choice and should never be pushed on others. Read Tantra: the Play of Awakening, and Apocalyptic Witchcraft.

Keep in mind that I don't endorse every word of these books but I kind of love every one of them, and that any of this that you can do and discuss with other supportive humans probably counts at least double. Write about it all in your notebook.
