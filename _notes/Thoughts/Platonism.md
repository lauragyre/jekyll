Platonism is about the philosophy of Plato, but more specifically it often refers to the current of thinking in which Plato is regarded as an important spiritual teacher. This wisdom is also believed to have come to/through Plato from an even earlier time from the Orphic cults, the Pythagoreans and/or from Egyptian religion or other foreign wisdom schools. 

While many common conceptions of Plato's work come from outside of this tradition, traditional Platonic ideas include integration of polytheistic religion, complex spiritual practice ([[Theurgy|theurgy]]), and arguably even a certain approach to scientific work such as [[Aristotle]]'s. 

Platonism has been hugely influential throughout European (and Arab â€“ there are especially close [[Sufism|connections between Platonism and Sufism]]) history, including massive impacts on Renaissance thinking and the Transcendental movement.

- There's a strong [[Void|apophatic]] current that's naturally quite hard to describe but feels like a very important aspect of this tradition.
