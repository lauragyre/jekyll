[[Tarot]]

There are some cups on the ground and a figure walking away from them (and us), starting to climb a mountain. There may be more cups along the mountain path.

The sense is of stepping off the beaten path and starting to move toward something more unique in the future. What lies ahead may be hard to see, so the ability to trust in what you feel as you move toward that future is important. Cups along the way could represent the fact that, as you move, you may be encouraged by signs and synchronicities showing that you're on the right track. 

There's also a sense of the need to make some sacrifices in order to move in this new direction. It may be primarily the ease of (and ego attachment to) following a pre-determined path, but there may also be other losses that must be acknowledged and negotiated in order to successfully move forward. 

There are some shades of the Hermit here, with a similar emphasis on the need to move forward in a very personal and somewhat mysterious way â€” but the Eight of Cups places more emphasis on a path of external action. There's a need to maintain a sense of internal guidance while also accomplishing worldly tasks and relating to others. [[Metaphor|Analogical thinking]], or another way of understanding that inner and outer paths can meaningfully reflect each other, may be particularly crucial here.
