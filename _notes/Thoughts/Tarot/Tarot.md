[I offer tarot readings](https://lauragyre.com/tarotreading), mostly with the beautiful [Fyodor Pavlov tarot](https://www.fyodorpavlov.com/tarot). 

I also highly, highly recommend the long, dense book *Meditations on the Tarot* (I'm making some reading notes [[Meditations on the Tarot|here]]), [Jessica Dore](http://jessicadore.com) as a tarot writer and teacher, Robert Place's *The Tarot: History, Symbolism and Divination* (spoiler alert: it's all very [[Platonism|Platonist]]) and the generally intuitive approach to reading described in *Tarot â€” the Open Reading* by Yoav Ben-Dov.
