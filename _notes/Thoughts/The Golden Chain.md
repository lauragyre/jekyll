First referenced in the Illiad:

"Try me and find out for yourselves. **Hang me a golden chain from heaven, and lay hold of it all of you, gods and goddesses together** - tug as you will, you will not drag Zeus the supreme counselor from heaven to earth; **but were I to pull at it myself I should draw you up with earth and sea into the bargain, then would I bind the chain about some pinnacle of Olympus and leave you all dangling in the mid firmament**. So far am I above all others either of gods or men."

"Now shall I go on and mention to you also windless air, calm sea, and all that sort of thing, and say that stillness causes decay and destruction and that the opposite brings preservation? And shall I add to this the all-compelling and crowning argument that Homer by “the golden chain”1 refers to nothing else than the sun," - Socrates to Theaetetus
