metaphor of situational awareness as awareness of the number of different perspectives

If you're anywhere near the autism spectrum, you're probably getting pretty sick of hearing about situational awareness. What people mean when they say this to you is that they think you aren't looking when you cross the street. The situation they may not be aware of when they say this is that there are always lots of situations going on. For example, the situation with snakes, which my younger child is accutely aware of. Or, for example, the situation with etymology, which I personally find pretty hard to ignore. The situation there is that all conceptual words are made out of other words until you get back to words that mean things about situational awareness. For example, the word "situation" means where something sits or is placed, or in other words its perspective. 

One thing that studies have shown about autism is that people on the spectrum may be less sensitive to context. When you read that, you probably think of a social context, and we are famous for getting those mixed up. But there are lots of types of context, like the impact of advertising, or like peer pressure. Sometimes it's a strength to know that you didn't need any of whatever when you walked into the store and you don't need any now, or that believe in what you believe in regardless of whether anybody agrees with you.

herbalism/medicine: autistic people may have more porous tissues leading to issues with the blood-brain barrier and also digestion, a tendency to food intolerances due to leaky gut and inflammatory conditions in response to this (does the inflammation decrease the porousness?)

- trickster function of creating outlets and crossing boundaries
