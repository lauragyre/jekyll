[[Synchronicity Tracker]]

![[keychain.jpeg]]My parents have boxes of Christmas ornaments for me and my sister, and every year we look through them and the meticulous lists they have kept of where and when we got all the ornaments…except that this year (2019), on top of the tissue paper, we each had one of these “Cornish Piskies” — which weren’t mentioned on the lists and we couldn’t remember ever seeing before.

My parents denied any knowledge of what they were or where they came from. I also asked my Grandmother when we went to visit because it looks old and mysterious, and she also denied any knowledge (but she’s ninety-nine years old, so I’m taking that with a grain of salt). She did say that some of her family is from Cornwall, so I’m guessing it’s some kind of weird old family item. Anyway, we both took them home.  

Google says these were popular lucky charms for Cornish houses, though I couldn’t find this exact model. And then I lost it and forgot about it and found it again today while I was making a lucky magical necklace, which seemed like too much of a coincidence to ignore.
