I think this is [[Shape Thoughts Book Notes|another book]], or it might be one some day. 

Maybe it starts with a butterfly? Not sure why yet, something about meta pherein (carrying accross), something about Psyche (the goddess, the butterfly, the soul, the breath).

Notes on the intersection of metaphor and magic:

- *[[Ensouling Language]]* analogical thinking is what writing is, and writing is what magic is
- *[[Meditations on the Tarot]]* analogical thinking is the fundamental magical skill
- Both of these processes mimic the analogical moment central to conversational hypnosis
- If every thought is metaphorical, maybe magic is the process of seeing that structure and skillfully navigating between metaphors
- Anthropology of Magic says that magic is analogical thinking (flipped to this heading when I first opened the book)

More about metaphor:

- [[Philosophy in the Flesh]], an introduction to metaphorical thinking
- [[On Truth and Lies]] - Nietzsche
- Ricoeur on [[The Rule of Metaphor|living vs. dead metaphor]]
- Plato's [[Seventh Letter]]
  
I wrote a paper on [[Aristotle and Metaphor]], which I think is pretty magical. Among other things, he said: “The greatest thing by far is to have a command of metaphor. [[Metaphor Can't Be Taught|This alone cannot be imparted by another]]; it is the mark of genius, for to make good metaphors implies an eye for resemblances.”
