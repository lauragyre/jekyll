One of my favorite bits of #etymology trivia is that the word *analyze* means to break down, while *synthesize* means to put together. This is an interesting window into what it means to understand something analytically: It's a very real and impactful type of understanding, but by its nature the opposite of holistic. 

The importance of the [[Alchemy|alchemical]] *solve et coagula* process as applied to knowledge can probably not be overstated. I'm hoping that the ability to apply a bit more *synthesis* or *coagulation* to the writing process will be a feature of this note-taking and publication system.
