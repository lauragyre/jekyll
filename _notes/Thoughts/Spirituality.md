For a long time I've described myself as an Animist [[2020 Hedge Notes|Hedge]] Witch â€” which certainly isn't wrong, though my spiritual roots also include Anglicanism, Tibetan Buddhism, and chaos magic. I've also been deeply influenced by Sufism, the Tantric traditions, Daoism, and roughly Jungian mysticism/psychology/trance and hypnosis stuff. 

Over the past few years, though, I've realized that the specific magical and religious currents that speak to me most profoundly (including [[Tarot|tarot]], the elemental system, and certain types of work with [[Metaphor and Magic|metaphor]]) can almost all be traced back to [[Platonism]]. So, my current religious practice is mainly Greek Polytheism (Hekatean), and I've more often been describing myself as a [[Theurgy|Theurgist]].

I have a book on creative Witchcraft slated for publication in 2022, and [a magical podcast](http://anchor.fm/lauragyre) occasionally. I also wrote this short piece, [[Eight Things I Think About Magic]], and an even shorter one on [[Spiritual Suggestions for People Who Read Too Much|Spiritual Practice for People Who Read Too Much]].

I also have a running list of recent [[Synchronicity Tracker|synchronicities]], if you'd like to see some working notes on that kind of thing.
