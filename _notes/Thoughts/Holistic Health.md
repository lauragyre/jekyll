I have post-lyme ME/CFS and my husband has MS, so while I've been thinking about holistic health for a long time, the way I think about it now has taken on entirely new dimentions. 

Here's [[MS Protocol|something we wrote about the protocols we use]] (very similar for both of us) to manage our inflammation and symptoms on a day to day basis).

We also do a lot of whole food, gluten-free (and usually grain-free, aside from rice) cooking, and I'm slowly adding to a [[Recipes|recipe]] section here.
