I think a good definition of philosophy might be *the study of questions*. What are the most interesting and impactful questions we could come up with, and where could the study of those questions lead?

Since we can't think [[Analysis and Synthesis|analytically]] about everything at once, there's a constant tendency in academia to focus on certain questions and ignore others. So, the nature of the most interesting, largely overlooked questions may evolve over time, as a sort of [[Cultural Shadows|shadow of the general state of knowledge]] â€” and maybe this is why philosophy is important. 

What is almost impossible for us to think about, and why?

- [[Stephen Harrod Buhner]] [[Ensouling Language|describes writing]] in similar terms.
- My philosophical favorites are usually about [[Platonism]], [[Metaphor and Magic]].
