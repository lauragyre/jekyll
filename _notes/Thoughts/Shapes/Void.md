An apophatic shape.

- idea of not being able to look directly at the sun entailed (I believe) in the concept of sun as a central metaphor in Platonism. Black sun, midnight sun, alternate sun from within

One of the super compelling things about [[Platonism]] for me is a pretty intense apophatic current. There's a central metaphor about the sun (this may end up in [[Aristotle and Metaphor|my paper]]) which can be understood just as an obvious kind of central source of life but also, I think importantly, as a thing you can't really look at. This is a metaphorical shape that's pretty much defined by how weirdly difficult it is to perceive and discuss, and there are lots of concepts with roughly similar outlines — concepts around the way that whatever edges (or centers) of reality don't quite fit into descriptive metaphors can't quite be "looked at" conceptually (except for sort of out of the corner of your eye). That's a lot of super imprecise language, but it's something I've been intensely mulling over on a [[Shape Thoughts Index|shape thought]] level. 

"I think there is a general misconception that you write poems because you “have something to say.” I think, actually, that you write poems because you have something echoing around in the bone-dome of your skull that you cannot say. Poetry allows us to hold many related tangential notions in very close orbit around each other at the same time. The “unsayable” thing at the center of the poem becomes visible to the poet and reader in the same way that dark matter becomes visible to the astrophysicist. You can’t see it, but by measure of its effect on the visible, it can become so precise a silhouette you can almost know it." -Rebecca Lindenberg

"I love white space, love the telling omission...and find oddly depressing that which seems to have left out nothing." -Louise Gluck

"All earthly experience is partial. Not simply because it is subjective, but be ause that which we do not know, of the universe, of mortality, is so much more vast than that which we do know. What is unfinished or has been destroyed participates in these mysteries. The problem is to make a whole that does not forfeit this power" -Louise Gluck
