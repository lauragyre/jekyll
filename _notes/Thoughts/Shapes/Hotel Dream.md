[[Shape Thoughts Index]]

Had a dream/thought while half asleep that people with different metaphor systems were like people in different rooms of a hotel. They are all there at once but there is a kind of figure/ground reversal, for each person they (and maybe certain others) are main characters and most other people are background characters. Also there was a feeling of weaving abstract shape thoughts or metaphors through the different rooms and people. Maybe the organization of rooms represents people's conscious identities and orientations? But there are invisible threads that can weave us together, subconsciously. In my half-asleep state, this felt like a big, important revelation.
