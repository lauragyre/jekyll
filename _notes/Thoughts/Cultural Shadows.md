[[Carl Jung]]

This reminds me of a description I once read (but have never been able to place after the fact) of witchcraft as the shadow of psychology. Basically, there's the implication that fields of knowledge, like people, have majorly impactful edges and flip-sides that are hard or impossible to see from within the paradigms of those disciplines themselves. 

Of course, everything in that shadow realm is a bit shadowy and hard to define precisely, so it's entirely possible that [[Philosophy|philosophy]] and witchcraft could both serve important shadow functions in relation to popular knowledge in different ways. It's also possible that philosophy, witchcraft, and arguably a number of related terms are all so hard to define that they're not meaningfully different.
