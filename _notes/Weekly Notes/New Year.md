### First Week of 2022: Special Holiday Edition

![[eight of cups 1.jpeg|200]]The tarot card I've drawn for 2022 (with the intention of sharing a public message) is the [[Eight of Cups|eight of cups]]. We've had a weird couple of years, but the message here is that it's time to get moving again. The question is, what are you moving toward? It's ok if you can't really imagine what the future might hold (and, really, that's always the case, even though it might seem otherwise). The important thing here is to see what's directly in front of you and practice feeling your way forward again. If you start to move in the right direction, there will always be signs along the way!

For me, it's increasingly clear that the right direction at the moment means focusing on my work with [[Metaphor|metaphor]]. That probably looks like more practice with analogical thinking, writing (as described in *[[Ensouling Language]]*) and hypnosis. I got lots of books for Christmas, so one of my specific [[Intentions for 2022|plans for the year]] is to get through *[[Meditations on the Tarot]]*. It's amazing so far and, curiously, starts out with a focus on analogical thinking â€” one of those signposts, for sure. Anyway, I'll probably share a lot more notes about that as the year progresses, as well as my work with another new book, *Seasons of a Magical Life: A Pagan Path of Living*.
