![[tarotbook.jpg|350]] This is Jessica Dore's new book about tarot. I haven't read it yet, but it's definitely beautiful! I took this picture, though, mostly to show you my new favorite stupid luxury item: a book dart. It's the little metal clip at the top of this page. You can use them to mark your favorite lines and there are over 100 in the package, so if you make notes once you're done reading you can reuse them indefinitely. 

In other book news, I'm supposed to turn in a back-of-book summary so my own book can actually get published. What do you think about this?

"[Book Title] is a collection of field notes and points of entry for seekers interested in witchcraft and related magical paths. These notes draw on the wisdom of a variety of spiritual traditions from ancient Greek philosophy to chaos magic, with detours through contemporary subjects like process psychology, evolutionary biology, and especially the arts.

Use this collection to start your first magical practice, deepen your experience of intuition, apply magical techniques to your creative work, or just get inspired about your next new direction. There’s plenty to digest here — and plenty of fun along the way — but the serious message is that the path you follow must ultimately be your own."
