# We made it through February! 

This month, I'm feeling a powerful need for some more personal organization. I didn't feel that great in February, and while that's pretty normal for me it also made me think a lot about health strategy. I'm also feeling a bit adrift following my failed attempt to apply for philosophy school, so I'm trying to put together a plan to keep working on that stuff on my own. 

## Here's how I'm dealing with my CFS at the moment:

1. Trying out this [autoimmune strength traininng](https://www.getautoimmunestrong.com/) program that goes super slowly and intentionally avoids overexertion/crashes. Also riding my new e-bike very cautiously and hoping there's an amount I can get away with that without feeling worse.
2. Wearing a smart watch and trying to figure out how to pace my activity better based on heart rate. 
3. Doing [yoga nidra](https://www.youtube.com/c/TripuraMandala/playlists) almost dailyâ€”bonus points from me for combining mid-day bed rest with meditation.  
4. Learning to bake better GF bread. [This one](https://www.letthemeatgfcake.com/fabulous-gluten-free-italian-bread/) can happen in a bread machine, and the texture is amazing!

## Here's my plan for the next stage of my self-taught philosophy program:

1. Practice music, do math apps, and work out (see above). Plato says that apps aside, those are all important prerequisites/accompaniments to philosophy, and I guess he should know. Also, on a similar note, meditation.
2. Contue to try to read Greek. I feel like I've tried everything, and I'm finally making some headway with the *JACT Reading Greek* series and this free [Memrise flashcard course](https://app.memrise.com/course/393012/jact-reading-greek-hardcore/). 
3. Read the anonymous *Prolegomena to Platonic Philosophy*. At least somebody wrote some instructions.
4. Read Porphyry's *Isagoge*, a Neoplatonic  introduction to Aristotle's categories which was considered a foundational text.
5. Read Aristotle's *Categories*.
6. Start on *A Comparative History of World Philosophy*
7. Read *The Shape of Ancient Thought* because I'm particularly interested in the massive number of similarities between Ancient Greek philosophy and various dharmic traditions. 
8. On the modern and metaphorical end of things, read *Where Mathematics Comes From*
9. Continue to sketch out my own [[Shape Thoughts Book Notes | book about metaphor, kind of]]

### In the meantime, here are a few other awesome things I've discovered:

- The book *Isis Unveiled*
- The book *Technic and Magic*
- The book *Trickster Makes the World*
- That the [Weird Studies podcast](https://www.weirdstudies.com/) has a [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/Jw22CHfGwp), and the discord server has a *Meditations on the Tarot* book club

Everything I want to do right now seems to take a really long time. That is not an awesome thing, IMO, but I'm trying to be ok with it and enjoy the process.
