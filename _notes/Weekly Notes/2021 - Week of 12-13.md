### Hi, I'm Laura Gyre. 

I'm a compulsive reader, a [[Writing|writer]], [[Illustration|illustrator]], and [[Web Development|web developer]], and a part-time [[Education|alternative educator]]. I have a deep and abiding interest in the power of [[Metaphor|metaphor]], as applied on both [[Analysis and Synthesis|logical]] and [[Intuition|intuitive]] levels. Another major passion at the moment is [[Greek Philosophy|Greek]] [[Philosophy|philosophy]], which I find connects to all of the above in curious ways! 

On a personal level, I'm also pretty interested in [[Habits Live in the Environment|habit design]] with a heavy emphasis on [[Creativity|creative]] and [[Spirituality|magical/spiritual]] praxis, and I think quite a bit about [[Holistic Health|holistic health]].

The nature of this note situation will always be that some of the notes are extremely unfinished. Questions? Comments?
