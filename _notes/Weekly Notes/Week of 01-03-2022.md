## I was curious about how this week would go.

![[scarf.jpg|350]]I spent the entire fall focused pretty intently on writing a [[Aristotle and Metaphor|philosophy paper]] so I could apply to grad school, only to learn that [[Holiday Gifts, 2021|I wouldn't be able to complete an application]]. Then the holidays happened. Now I'm back to work, the kids are back to school, and apparently what I wanted to think about this week was mostly herbs and dyeing. 

Last weekend I embroidered and dyed this scarf, which I'd been thinking about since I started using the [Orphic hymn](https://www.hellenicgods.org/the-orphic-hymn-to-hecate-aekati---hekate) that describes Hekate as κροκόπεπλος, *saffron-veiled*. Saffron is a fugitive dye (meaning it fades pretty quickly with normal use), so if you want saffron-colored clothing, you usually have to redye it every now and then. 

I also ran into a couple of other interesting natural dyes this week. Apparently you can stain wood black using steel wool dissolved in vinegar or tannic acid from tree bark. (I read a blog post about someone who did the entire outside of their house with this, and it looked great — but now I can't find it anywhere.) I also learned that you can get pretty brilliant, colorfast purples from relatively widespread mushrooms and lichens, which is awesome because I always heard that these colors were really hard to get from nature. One of the mushrooms is pretty toxic, but [this lichen seems ok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxi2Up7YhM4&ab_channel=JulianLiber). Future projects, I hope!

I also spent a lot of my free time this week listening to herbalism lectures from Commonwealth Herbs. I'm really impressed with these guys, especially their combination of energetic woo with real knowledge of physiology and phytochemistry. I was working on the energetics and pain management courses, but they also have a [pay-what-you-can community course](https://online.commonwealthherbs.com/courses/herbal-community-care-toolkit) that might be a good place to start if you're curious.  I finished the week with a migraine, which is usually a bummer, but I was kind of excited to get to try out some of these pain relief techniques. There's a big emphasis in herbalism on the unique aspects of every situation, but FWIW in my case I looked through what I had at home and managed to make it through a couple of days relatively pain-free with a combination of ginger, chamomile, mugwort and wintergreen oil — which was pretty impressive compared to the amount of tylenol I usually end up taking.
