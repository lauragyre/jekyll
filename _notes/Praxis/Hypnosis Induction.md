Hypnosis combines focused intention with bypass of critical faculty
good communication that has the ability to directionalize the mind
this is how we have to explain hypnosis: *what it's like*
- processing happens in the conscious mind but most subconscious - example of learning to drive vs driving with distractions
- repeated processes are stored as habits, different ideas (like becoming a non-smoker) bounce off wall of critical faculty which is intended to protect the efficiency of habits; this can occasionally be changed by building up habits with willpower until self-image or pattern finally shifts, but hypnosis makes a gap in this wall (demonstrate with arm) so the change we want can go in directly
- especially if they seem concerned, this happens many times per day naturally, example of watching a movie and the images go right in and cause emotion/physical/hormonal reactions. *We just don't usually consciously direct this process.* 
- sometimes even do bilateral stimulation before asking what they want to work on if they seem stressed
- **during this process, use a different voice to describe subconscious/ask client to imagine something and conscious/ask them to come back to set up a subconscious distinction**
- let's try something (maybe after they describe the problem): arm/twisting demonstration. you visualized something three times, and your unconscious mind communicated something important to your body. How many times this week have you played a movie in your mind about being on an airplane and you start to have a panic attack? That's right...it's called hypnosis, and you're using it brilliantly.[issue] this is all a form of hypnosis (anxiety also pushes aside the barrier, from the other side, to deal with situations)
- did you hear about...(relevant to subject)

Mini-trances during the pre-talk are a kind of fractionation

Capture a mental image of the client relaxed and laughing and hold this in mind during work as an outcome for them.
