I originally got into web stuff as a blogger who didn't want to pay for a website. If you're in the same boat, I recommend [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org), which is easy to get started with but also provides a pretty powerful and customizable pre-built backend if you ever get more interested in development like I did. (If you do want to learn more about web development, I *highly* recommend [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/.), which is a free alternative to a coding boot camp with tons and tons of resources).

I no longer have a WP day job, but I occasionally do small client projects. I'm also really enjoying working on this site with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which is a super robust productivity, publishing and thought-organization software that's exactly the right amount of hacky for me.
