- hypnosis is narrowing attention and pushing aside the critical faculty. extraordinary moments help people understand that this is different than everything else that they've tried
- conscious hand lifting induction (while subconsciously...) can transition to subconscious...maybe priming for rest of session?
- stop over-discussion, just looking for signs that they've accessed the memory. 
- metaphoric two step: what is this like, what could you do (or, subconscious moment, how is it related?)
- levels: stop it in the moment, suggestion that stopping starts positive change (knock down some specific incidents), subsconsious processing or meaning, learning
- methods to stop: bilateral stimulation, heart breathing, peripheral vision, space between
- body loop trance: going through different body points repeatedly, then waking up mind
- meta pattern: access problem state, dissociate (ask how they would like to feel) combine the two, ask how they feel now and keep repeating (can talk about looping)
- first session: teach four or five different pattern interrupts with different specific triggers inside metapattern, pre-talk with priming, teaching self-hypnosis pattern for daily use
- Pretalk: visualize conscious and subconscious normally foreign ideas and intentions bounce off of subconscious beliefs, unless the new habits and ideas can connect to some existing pattern in the subconscious. hypnosis can fold away that barrier. especially if person seems concerned, describe how this happens in movies and also show the body twisting demonstration (it's not hypnosis). We need conscious mind on board
- Self-hypnosis: fractionation with counting down ten to one, wave of relaxation on each as the number fades on a screen. Imagine that those legs are so heavy. Make a suggestion like "my legs are so heavy" and see how your body believes you. Some people find that when they try to lift those legs they feel even heavier. Make a movie of how you would like to be, when it's great float into the movie, let your brain try it on. Afterwards, as, what was that like?
- Mirroring hands: hold up and look at your hands like you haven't in a long time, notice whether they feel slightly different, notice which one will represent the problem and it can start to move on its own, then the other represents strengths and things you've learned, it can start to move on its own, if they don't go down to lap when you're ready to integrate what you've learned they can go down to your lap
- Wise advocate (can do right after mirroring hands, can lead to anything with advocate)
- Priming: warm room, soft chairs, heavy clipboard, coffee or tea
- campfire process: anyone is there who needs to be, child self says anything they need to say, everyone who needs to respond responds so you know you're heard, repeat from an adult perspective, allow child self to grow up and integrate

- for goals, if you have people connect to the feeling of having achieved the goal in the future, you have to bring that feeling back and attach it to the steps that are being resisted in the present.
- "feel how it feels/how does it feel when it's easier to...because...good result" "how does it feel when you're becoming a person who..."
