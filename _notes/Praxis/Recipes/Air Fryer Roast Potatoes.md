Potatoes
olive oil
salt
pepper

Bake potatoes as usual. When cool, peel if desired, and chop into large bites. Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with salt, and stir to coat. Spread out in an air fryer basket and cook at 350-400 for about 20 minutes, shaking at least once to mix and watching for burning.
