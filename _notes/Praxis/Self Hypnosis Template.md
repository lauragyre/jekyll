Tell the client:

feet on the floor
look at something upward
soften your gaze
in a moment I'm going to start counting down from ten to one and with every number I'll ask you to open and close your eyes
ten: close your eyes and feel a wave of relaxation go through you from your head to your toes. Visualize the number ten like it's on a screen in front of you and then allow that image to relax out of your mind
etc.

this fractionation keeps people focused on the process

even in a light state of relaxation like this, it's easier for your conscious mind to send messages to your body. Let me show you how powerful that is: notice the heaviness in your legs. you can start to allow those legs to feel even heavier. Say to yourself, my legs feel heavy, and pay attention to how that feels in your body when you say that *your legs feel heavy*. some people notice that heaviness even more when they try to lift their legs

imagine a movie screen in your mind - for some people this can be very vivid like you're actually looking at a screen in front of you and for some it feels more like you're just imagining it, so see how that works for you

visualize yourself on the screen doing what you want to be doing and feeling how you want to feel. when you're happy with the image, feel yourself floating into it and notice how being that person and doing that thing feels from the inside
