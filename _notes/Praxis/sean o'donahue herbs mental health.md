for a person in a flat, grey depression he would work to boost dopamine, which is involved in motivating survival activities through pleasure. Possibly appropriate for solar st. john's wort.

oxytocin motivates connection.
norepinephrine narrows focus and intensity for survival.

for a person in a brooding depression with recurring, obsessive thoughts he would recommend serotonin, which helps to balance the inside and the environment (and also creates more complex structure in plant roots and fungi)

also: black cohosh as a serotinergic aid, 1-3 drops two or three times a day, also anti-inflammatory and targets the meninges (!) so might help to allow drainage from brain and, metaphorically, drainage of obsessive thoughts or stuck patterns. bitterness may also help the vagus nerve?

psilocybin microdose (related to serotonin), especially with something creative or contemplative to engage in
possibly macrodose once a season

for bipolar states, rose for cooling and direction into safe creative activity for high energy phases, warming herbs for low phases
