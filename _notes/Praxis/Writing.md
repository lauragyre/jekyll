Besides lots of web content, I've also written a book about creative witchcraft that should be coming out in 2022. If you're interested in *my* writing, [[Writing Projects Index|this may be a good place to look first]], especially as I work to consolidate [[Future Writing Projects ?|more of my projects]] here in the future! 

If you're generally interested in writing, I recommend *[[Ensouling Language]]*, by [[Stephen Harrod Buhner]], *Walking on Water*, by Derrick Jensen,[[* ]]  and the Sense Writing Course ([free samples available!](http://www.sensewriting.org/sensewritings)), by Madelyn Kent. And, of course, just writing a lot â€” sorry about that.

I'm currently enjoying this platform ([Obsidian](http://obsidian.md)) very much for note organization and online publishing. 

These are [[Writing Inspirations|some of my favorite writers]].
