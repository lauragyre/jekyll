### pain relief

Combine different functions for pain relief:

Anodyne: respond to prostaglandins with salicylates (since they're turned into useful chemicals in the liver, they don't irritate the digestive tract like NSAIDs). These include willow and alder (which are cooling, drying, and toning, so beware) as well as meadowsweet and wintergreen (which due to volatile smelly compounds are more easily absorbed, so they work better than the others topically/for oral issues). Meadowsweet can be grown and only the flowers used for less cooling effect. (Also antimicrobial, wonder about making a tea of meadowsweet for first aid). Wintergreen oil in a topical preparation can help it penetrate better.

Analgesic: use spicy warming herbs like cayenne and clove topically. Don't use clove essential oil in mouth, especially for babies - it can numb the throat and cause breathing problems. Tincture is fine in mouth for most purposes, though chamomile is probably enough for babies. There herbs are tonifying; kava is warming but relaxing and also good for topical use if that's a concern.

Ghost pipe: 5-10 stems in a cup of tincture. Even a half cup preparation can last most practices a year or more, only a few drops are needed and only in the most resistant situations. It must be put in alcohol immediately (take alcohol jar with you). You should be able to see several clumps of ten or more stems from where you stand. Good for phantom limb pain, grief, centerless pain like MS nerve pain, fibromyalgia or endometriosis, situations where the physical reality can't necessarily be changed and we need to help our nervous system adapt to that reality (though, generally doing everything we can to reduce inflammation and support nerve health). In chronic conditions, can be used as a bridge for a month or so to make it possible to establish health habits and get slower change rolling. You can't will yourself to get there, but you need help for the nerves to build new pathways. Many people eventually realize they've learned what they need to and don't need ghost pipe anymore. "intense world syndrome" in autism or similar.

Mugwort may assist with sympathetic/parasympathetic balance. (not from class, looked this up)

St. John's Wort helps to build nerves and restore myelin sheath, can be used topically.

Jamaican dogwood might be good, it's a sedative that especially helps with nerve pain. Migraine? MS? It does lower heart rate slightly and should be used in smaller doses â€” 20-30 drops of tincture, can increase if you don't feel anything after 20 minutes. May also help with anxiety along with pain

Wild lettuce can make you sleepy/induce sleep. Take higher doses in the evening. Useful for pain that makes it hard to relax mentally and/or fall asleep. After surgery or overworking whole body, for example. Wild lettuce is cold, may not be great over time, but you can include ginger (good choice because it also addds and anti-spasmodic action). Tea or tincture (tincture may be better before bed and is often better/contains the strongest nervine sedative and analgesics that come from the white milky sap of the stalk that's less present after drying). You can also score stalks and collect sap, which is very potent. Tincture is almost as good; pack a jar with as many stalk and leaf-base parts as possible and cover with alcohol.

California poppy is a more mild overall sedative, maybe good when there's more general discomfort than intense pain. It may have the opposite effect (causing high energy) in people doing HRT or similar. 

Marijuana: helps some people. Other things also act on the endocannabinoid system: like prickly ash and chocolate. For pain, use at least half and half CBD to THC. People can be allergic to it!

Chamomile is a powerful relaxant, helps with muscular tension pain like gut pain, back pain, emotional tension. Must be brewed much stronger than it usually is...maybe four teabags in a cup (until it's a dark mahogany color) with a lid on to contain the volatile oils. Good combo with ginger, Katja prefers this for headaches including migraine. Chamomile is also good for an eye mask or wound wash. It's also possible to have an allergy (daisy family, ragweed, though won't necessarily react to all members of the family the same way). Chamomile is also great for teething, can take the edge off the discomfort (can chew on dry chamomile in a bag).

Passionflower a good relaxant with/for racing/circling thoughts. Tincture is good (maybe a tablespoon), especially at night (less sedative that hops or wild lettuce). You could also drink a quart of tea, maybe mixed with ginger or tulsi.

Wood betony is extremely helpful for migraines, post-concussive disorders.

Passionflower, tulsi and ginger is a good combo for mental pain.

Tulsi stimulates the hippocampus, which helps us process our experiences into memory (cortisol damages this part).

Vervain can really help with nausea.

Motherwort fortifying when you need to push through things, good for heart pain and palpitations.

Lobelia is an intense relaxant that may cause vomiting. 3-5 drops of tincture is a good place to start experimenting. If you don't feel relaxed after some time, you can try more. Can also use the tincture topically. Good for intense muscle cramps or spasms. Can help with anaphylactic attacks and asthma.

Wild yam and cramp bark are strong relaxants especially for body tubes...intestinal issues, passing kidney stones, blood vessels, blood vessels, uterine wall and other muscular organs. 

Solomon's seal supports the healing of connective tissue, also osteoarthritis. It brings moistness and sproinginess to these tissues. Also COPD?

Seaweed for topical use (especially bone or muscle injury pain) as well as internally.

St. John's wort helps to rebuild nerve function over time. However, St. John's Wort taken internally can have various interactions with prescription medications.

Damiana also helps to bring blood and nutrients to nerves throughout the body (for example, for diabetic neuropath).

Lion's mane

Blook-movers help by reducing stagmation (bruises), bringing nutrients for healing, delivering other medicines, and washing away waste products of pain process, can help with numbness. Prickly ash is a good one. Internal tincture and/or tincture melted into salve. When you put it in your mouth, it should feel tingly. 

Cayenne moves blood, brings relaxation with warmth, and helps mop up substance P. This process takes time, so may require repeated applications (such as several times a day on injuries) is much more effective. You should tincture cayenne first and then add the tincture to salve rather than extracting directly into oil. Some people have sensitivity to cayenne (nightshade). 

Get similar effects from ginger, horseradish, urtication.
 
#### questions

What about coffee? The taste is overwhelmingly bitter but I would guess it's mainly a stimulant and astringent

How to assess risk? Is it bad to put wintergreen oil on my skin because one person got poisoned?

Cool and dry: what to do. So many herbs are drying, does this just mean constantly taking heroic doses of moistening herbs to counteract their effects? Also, it just seems like a bit of an unusual combination.

What are limits of using these things in chronic conditions?

How much should I think about getting sensitized to things like herbs or essential oils?

Is ginger on its own a good relaxant similar to chamomile in some ways? It's mentioned in several formulas, but is there a reason it's not included on its own?

How to use solomon's seal.

How to prepare lion's mane as medicine. (Can just grow it and eat it).

### neurology/emotional

hops for sleep (important to get sleep)

wild lettuce for sleep with pain that makes it difficult

st. john's wort oil for nerves

milky oats/oat straw to build nerves and resilience (evening primrose has a similar function and is maybe better for a lot of people because of gluten cross-reactivity)

tulsi after shocking or traumatic events, maybe with rose honey

rose generally as protective, uplifting, "anti-depressant," drop rose water in hot water for "tea"

lion's mane (you can eat it) for nerve healing

salicylates like birch and willow need to be used regularly to create full pain-relieving effects

motherwort for emotional strength and boundaries

purslane for minerals, "nettles for dry people"

marshmallow to add to drying preparations, maybe also good for dry and depleted nerves

lemonbalm

ghost pipe for shock and loss, may create a permanent adjustment to new state

cayenne and prickly ash as blood movers, getting effects to different parts of the body

protein and fats important for nerve health, can't adequately be synthesized from plant foods without lots of inefficiency
