Mugwort (from Germanic words meaning power root) has been used in tea since the iron age, and is the main herb used in [Alpine smoke cleansing](https://druidryblog.wordpress.com/2015/02/02/smudging-alpine-style/). This includes home cleansing during the 12 days following solstice or Christmas (rauhnachten, celebrated to drive out evil spirits since at least the 1700s), as well as during sickness. Could also be combined with juniper (for health) and/or evergreen saps. 

Mugwort grows by railroads and dumps, as well as natural areas. It's a possible abortifacient, helpful for headaches, nerve problems, menstrual cramps (salve) and stomach distress. Used in Ayurveda for cardiac complaints, feelings of unease and general malaise. East Asian traditions also use mugwort sticks in moxibustion and ritual. 

And, of course, it's amazing for dreams! I have definitely found this to be true, especially when I started using it for the first time.
