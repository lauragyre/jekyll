spaced out hand induction

in a moment I want you to create a beautiful staircase
as we step down ten steps going deeper inside/into relaxation with every step
count down etc. with each step
in a moment (but not yet) I'm going to ask you to create a beautiful door
many people like to have a way to communicate with your unconscious mind and so we're going to create a wise advocate that already knows so much more
so in a moment we're going to open that door...

are you aware of your wise advocate (nod your head)
you can ask any question you'd like a bit of insight into
knowing you can get back here whenever you choose

at your own rate and speed, make your way back up these stairs

sometimes people have so internalized this wise advocate that I'm going to ask you to imagine sitting down in this safe and comfortable space and just ask yourself any question
