<img src="/assets/snakeshed.png" style="float: left"> I do mostly pen and ink/watercolor illustration, especially of natural and magical subjects. I don't have a great portfolio site up currently, but I do work on commission, so please get in touch if you'd like to see more!

Like most artists, people often tell me that they wish they could draw. My take on this is that if you keep practicing, you'll get there! Personally, I recommend smooth (hot press) bristol paper, mechanical pencils, nice ballpoint pens and affordable watercolors. 

Personally, I also love art nouveau and the color [shadow violet](https://www.jacksonsart.com/en-us/daniel-smith-watercolour-paint-5ml-shadow-violet)for inspiration.
