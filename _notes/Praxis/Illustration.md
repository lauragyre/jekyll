<img src="/assets/snakeshed.png"> I do pen and ink/watercolor illustration, especially of natural and magical subjects. You can see some of my work, visit my print shop, and contact me for custom projects at [lauragyre.com](http://lauragyre.com).

Like most artists, people often tell me that they wish they could draw. My take on this is that if you keep practicing, you'll get there! Personally, I recommend smooth (hot press) bristol paper, mechanical pencils, nice ballpoint pens and affordable watercolors. 

I love art nouveau and the color [shadow violet](https://www.jacksonsart.com/en-us/daniel-smith-watercolour-paint-5ml-shadow-violet).
