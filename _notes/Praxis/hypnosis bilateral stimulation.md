think of an anxiety-producing situation (watch how they look. are they visually looking for it?)
ask her to rate on a scale, then to turn it up a little (that teaches control without provoking resistance)
ok, follow me (relax self, shoulders down, nodding, connecting, etc.)
explain process (distract the conscious mind, embed commands)
the reason *this works* is because anxiety, primarily (sing-songy)
that anxiety you had can't keep itself together
