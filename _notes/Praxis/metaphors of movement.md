what is it like? until either a metaphor or they say I don't know
what's to the left, right, in front, behind (can reframe this as what they've left or what's left for them, what's right for them or the right path, what's ahead of them, what's behind them or they've left behind)
then what do you do?
scenario where you lead them on a path and see someone doing the same thing, tell them to do the same thing
