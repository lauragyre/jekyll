You know your child learns best through play. Let them keep playing next year, at TRVS.

Your child has been learning through play since birth. Let her keep playing next year, at TRVS.

Three Rivers Village School is a democratic school for kids ages 5-18. Children choose all of their own activities, which often means playing all day! We find (and research shows) that natural learning doesn't stop in Kindergarten. Over time, kids at TRVS find their own way toward skills like reading, conflict resolution, computer literacy, hand crafts, field trip planning, social engagement, student government, and learning to pursue personal goals on their own terms.
