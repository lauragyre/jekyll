Budgeted $50 I'm making from Brilliant interview to magic cards 
Spent 4th week of April (week of April 18) on Alan Moore class

Owe $5 on extra magic card $10 perfumed scorpion and $10 on daoism book, owe $25 for additional paperbackswap credits, $30 on book, so will have $5 spending that week -- oops, no, actually overspent by $45 on books/lecture (paid $15 off with poster sale, so $30 over) This should hopefully be paid by my wyzant session, more or less. then also spent $35 on art, so currently $65 over. Ok! $30 paid by Wyzant session, so currently owe $35. Thursday's session? $20 cancellation fee, so I owe $15

Got $80 extra so by week of May 9 I am owed $180 total. Spent $145 on keyboard and muse, $45 on books so I owe $10. Also spent $30 on printmaking supplies so I owe $40. Then did $25 of work for Willow, then spent $10 on annual writing app subscription, so I still owe $25. Spent $7 on a book, owe $32. paid extra $10 by brilliant, so owe $22 extra 10 from willow, so. $12, then spent up to $80 total, then up to $105 total (tarot deck, books). This will now actually be paid off (except $5) the actual week of May 9

 Week of July 18 spent $110 extra for shoes, so owe 80 after this week's payment. $40 app charge returned, so owe $40...or have $10 left of August money. that $40 will be paid off week of July 25 and I will be left with $60 spent $15 on printing supplies so will be left with $45 spent all of that. actually, spent remaining $45 and $45 of Augost money, leaving $5. Spent another $25 on audiobook, meaning I have spent my August money and owe $20 the week of August 1 Also spent $10 on a clipboard, owe $30. Spent $10 on pigment, owe $40, spent $10 on book. This leaves $40 for horseback riding and $10 for clay...but am probably going to sell a print to Mel for $30 or so.

savings budgets end of March : 3900 savings, 925 home, 375 furnace, 400 tuition = 5675 - 900 future tax to be paid back to selves = 4775

End of April: hopefully 4200, 925 home, 375 furnace, 200 tuition = 5700 - 800 future tax to be paid back to selves = 4900 cash   except, minus 1200 for fridge, so 3700 cash. Extra 300 would be income tax, 100 gift savings = 4100

actually have 3900 in accounts at end of month, L owes 300 = 4200 J "owes 550" = 4750 

End of May: hopefully 4000 (reduced 500 for car), 890 home, 375 furnace, 0 tuition = 5265 - 700 future tax repayment = 4565 cash - 1200 fridge = 3365 cash + 500 tax savings = 3865

End of June: hopefully 3100 (reduced 500 more for car expenses), 890 home, 375 furnace = 4365 - 600 future tax repayment = 3765 plus possibly 1000 tax savings would equal 4765

should be 3765 will really be 2000 
down 1700 from: tires 175
                             l health program 300

new savings plan:

Weekly minimum is $700, put $100 to income taxes (however, we may luck out this year due to having paid a lot of back taxes). In the future, may have to raise that to $900 to cover extra food and medical expenses, reduce personal money to $50 each per thousand.


James: 5/15
owe 396 to nick from business
owe 88 to dave from business

James 5/30

J still owes 396 to nick
J still owes 88 to dave (James took 90 cash out of drawer to cover this and needs to pay it back)
