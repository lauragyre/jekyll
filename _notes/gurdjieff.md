_Gurdjieff notably availed himself of dervish culture, especially in his_

_Sacred Dances and Movements, and allowed that there was genuine_

_knowledge in alchemy, astrology, the Tarot, and ancient folk traditions, if_

_they were understood correctly.__7_ _At the same time, Gurdjieff not_

_infrequently pointed to what he said were gaps in these teachings, but added_

_that his system supplemented and corrected them; for instance, while stating_

_that alchemists, fakirs, and monks had some understanding of the necessary_

_path of spiritual development, he averred that they left out or did not know_

_of “self-remembering,” the vital preparatory step.


Ouspensky:

In school one cannot begin with knowledge of all. So one begins with fragments. First
one studies fragments relating to the psychological side, then fragments relating to
man’s place in the world, etc. After several fragments have been studied, one is told to
try and connect them together. If one is successful, one will have in this way the
whole picture. And then one may be able to find the right place for each separate
thing. There is no other way. One cannot learn the system from books.
As a matter of fact I have written down and described how we met the system
and studied it. But I realized what a different impression it all produces on readers as
compared to us who actually were there. A reader will never be able to find the right
center of gravity, so this book would be like any other book. This is why there are not
text books on the system. Things can be written only for those who have studied.
