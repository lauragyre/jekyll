"Eliot then said what seemed to me the centre and luminous point of the entire interview: 'But intelligence pushed to its depths leads to mysticism.'Do you not believe,' I asked him ..., that intellect and mysticism are two faculties which are opposed in humar nature? A sign of denial was his only response, and this afirmaion: "All human faculties pushed to their depths end in mysticism." (my translation from the French, 3) Donald J. Childs

Qn the one hand is Bergson, high priest of the Life Force. On the other is James, judging the worth of ideas by their practical consequences or 'cash value'. As Eliot knew them, they both offered themselves as honest brokers between the ideal and the real, hoping (in Bergson's terms) to solve a good number of metaphysical disputes bymerely getting rid of the clumsy symbols round which we are fighting' (1889, xix). Eliot allowed neither claim, however, treating James as representative of the suâ„¢bject side of philosophy and treating Bergson as representative of the object side. His response to their limitations was to embark on his own search for the middle way between the ideal and the real.
