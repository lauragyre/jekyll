The Four Agreements is a really readable book that lays out some basic principles for psychological and energetic clarity. While I'm generally not much for ethical guidelines, I think the commonsense work in this book would be a really solid place to start a spiritual practice, and a good preparation for further magical work. 

The principles are:

1. Be impeccable with your word.
2. Don't make assumptions.
3. Don't take things personally.
4. Always do your best.

That will, IMO, get you pretty far, and if I'm feeling out of whack these principles (as well as journaling) are touchstones that I return to often.
