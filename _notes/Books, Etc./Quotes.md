"To the degree you approach the truth, your solitude will increase. Keep going. Don't be afraid. The worst has already taken place. Of course life will rip you apart again, but, you no longer have much to do with it.” - Houellebecq


“trying is only emphasizing the thing we already know." (F. M. Alexander)
  
"philosophers are beings who have passed through a death, who are born from it, and go towards another death, perhaps the same one…. The philosopher has returned from the dead and goes back there. This has been the living formulation of philosophy since Plato." — Gilles Deleuze

"...when you are convinced that all the exits are blocked, either you take to believing in miracles or you stand still like the hummingbird. The miracle is that the honey is always there, right under your nose, only you were too busy searching elsewhere to realize it. The worst is not death but being blind, blind to the fact that everything about life is in the nature of the miraculous." - Henry Miller

"With the knowledge and potential experience that this book contains, Hermetic practitioners will hold the essence, the key, of the Royal Art. Should these pratitioners refer to the ancient and obscure alchemical texts, they will appear to be "lit from within."  - Tower of Alchemy

"At that point, it is as if you were to stand on a mountain top watching a raging storm below—the storm may go on, but you are outside of it, to some extent objective, no longer emotionally stressed. There is a sense of peace. This is not essentially different from the traditional Christian concept of grace—“the peace that passeth understanding”—except that it doesn’t come from a distant God; it wells up inside." -analyst Frith Luton on the transcendent function

Focusing on the next experimental step is neither settling for less nor going for more, he says, rather “[it’s more like being right where you are — more intensely](https://substack.com/redirect/6b06d105-bedf-49fd-8481-e160dc01b606?j=eyJ1IjoiMnR2MnkifQ.ZoWwu4ZcuEn78nxdFq3Ms0mxggZzmwFUgYH49Fv9sWg). - Brian Massumi


“Everything is interwoven, and the web is holy; none of its parts are unconnected. They are composed harmoniously, and together they compose the world. One world, made up of all things. One divinity, present in them all. - Marcus Aurelius

"We cannot change anything until we accept it**. Condemnation does not liberate, it oppresses." - Jung

"Even though my hands were making all the movements, some of them extremely complicated and at a very rapid pace, I didn’t have to think about them at all. I’ve never had a genuine out-of-body experience, but this came close. I almost felt as if I were an observer to the music-making, not an active participant. The joy of feeling this sense of control while also _losing control_ is impossible to express in words." 
[...]
"This transformation can happen in the least likely situations. Research shows that teachers who achieve flow states—and not just during performance but merely in classroom activities—are more likely to impart a similar mindset to their students. In other words, musicians have special skills both as participants in these transformational experiences, and as [conductors of them](https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/what-do-conductors-really-do)—mimicking the ancient literature to a striking degree.""

"Throw your dreams into space like a kite, and you do not know what it will bring back, a new life, a new friend, a new love, a new country." -Anais Nin

"as soon as you trust yourself you will know how to live" - Goethe, Faust
"God help us - for art is long and life so short" 
"more light, more light! Open the window so that more light may come in" -Goethe's last words?

“In my early professional years I was asking the question: How can I treat, or cure, or change this person? Now I would phrase the question in this way: How can I provide a relationship which this person may use for his own personal growth?” ― Carl R. Rogers

We have no one to guide us. Our only guide is our homesickness. -Hesse

"The Christian idea proves its vitality by a continuous evolution, just like Buddhism"

"Whatever I perceive from without or within is a representation or image… caused, as I rightly or wrongly assume, by a corresponding “real” object. But I have to admit that my subjective image is only grosso modo identical with the object…

our images are, as a rule, of something… The God-image is the expression of an underlying experience of something which I cannot attain to by intellectual means…" (Jung 1959, clarifying "I don't believe, I know.")

"I did not say in the broadcast, "There is a god," I said "I do not need to believe in God; I know." Which does not mean: I do know a certain God (Zeus, Jahwe, Allah, the Trinitarian God, etc.) but rather: I do know that I am obviously confronted with a factor unknown in itself, which I call 'God' in consensu omnium "quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus creditur." I remember Him, I evoke Him, whenever I use His name overcome by anger or by fear, whenever I involuntarily say: "Oh God!"

That happens when I meet somebody or something strong than myself. It is an apt name given to all overpowering emotions in my own psychical system subduing my conscious will and usurping control over myself. This is the name by which I designate all things which cross my willful path violently and recklessly, all things which upset my subjective views, plans, and intentions and change the course of my life for better or worse. In accordance with tradition I call the power of fate in this positive as well as negative aspect, and inasmuch as its origin is beyond my control, 'god', a 'personal god', since my fate means very much myself, particularly when it approaches me in the form of conscience as a vox Dei, with which I can even converse and argue. (We do and, at the same time, we know that we do. One is subject as well as object.)

Yet I should consider it an intellectual immorality to indulge in the belief that my view of a god is the universal, metaphysical Being of the confessions or 'philosophies'. I do neither commit the impertinence of a hypostasis, nor of an arrogant qualification such as: 'God can only be good.' Only my experience can be good or evil, but I know that the superior will is based upon a foundation which transcends human imagination. Since I know of my collision with a superior will in my own psychical system, I know of God, and if I should venture the illegitimate hypostasis of my image, I would say, of a God beyond good and evil, just as much dwelling in myself as everywhere else: Deus est circulus cuius centrum est ubique, cuis circumferentia vero nusquam." 



Symbolism should come by itself. It is not something that one can study or learn - Inayat Khan, sounding like Aristotle

_If you fix them in your strong intelligence_and gaze upon them propitiously with pure attention,_
_these things will all be very much present to you all your__life long,__and from them you will obtain many others. For these very__things__grow into each kind of character, depending on each__person’s nature_

_But if you reach out for other kinds of things, such as the__millions__of wretched things that are found among men that blunt__their thoughts,__indeed they will quickly leave you as time revolves,__longing to come to their own dear kind.__For know that all things possess thought and a portion of__intelligence_ -Empedocles via Hipollytus


_The Pythagoreans similarly posited two principles, but__added something peculiar to themselves, not that the limited and__the unlimited are distinct natures like fire or earth or something__similar, but that the unlimited itself and the one itself are the substance__of what they are predicated of. This is why they call number__the substance of all things._ - Philolaus via Aristotle


_Some logoi are stronger than we are._ - Philolaus via Aristotle


It is not possible to reach and approach with our eyes or grasp it with our hands, by which the most powerful highway of persuasion strikes the minds of men. (Empedocles according to Clement, Miscellanies 5.81)

We know [God] only...by his most wise and best designs (structuras) of things...[He] is said to see, to hear, to speak...by allegory...For all talk of God is appropriated from human affairs by a certain similitude. -Newton Principia Mathematic, as 

quoted in The Logos of Heraclitus


But no matter how much parents and grandparents may have sinned against the child, the man who is really adult will accept these sins as his own condition which has to be reckoned with. Only a fool is interested in other people's guilt, since he cannot alter it. -Jung




The Work is something living in our hearts and minds. Follow the path, see what changes take place within you, and what light begins to dawn in you. -maurice nicoll

“If you bring forth what is within you, **what you bring forth will save you**. If you do not bring forth what is within you, what you do not bring forth will destroy you.”

Jesus said, "Images are visible to people, but the light within them is hidden in the image of the Father's light. He will be disclosed, but his image is hidden by his light."

"His disciples asked him and said to him, "Do you want us to fast? How should we pray? Should we give to charity? What diet should we observe?"

Jesus said, "Don't lie, and don't do what you hate, because all things are disclosed before heaven. After all, there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, and there is nothing covered up that will remain undisclosed. -Gospel of Thomas

''When you feel you are empty and have no understanding, continue calmly, do not try to attain something. Feel this emptiness, taste it, and finally you will discover that it is alive. - [#MichelConge](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MichelConge?src=hashtag_click), [#Gurdjieff](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gurdjieff?src=hashtag_click)-ian

"The sources, the roots, of being lie, in fact, in that which is hidden and not in that which is revealed: Deus est Deus absconditus (God is a hidden God)." -Lev Shestov

“How difficult it is, though, to refrain from replacing the thing with its sign, to keep the object alive before us instead of killing it with a word." -Goethe

"Presumably all obsessions are extreme metaphors waiting to be born. That whole private mythology, in which I believe totally, is a collaboration between one's conscious mind and those obsessions that, one by one, present themselves as stepping-stones." - j.g. ballard

"The divine emptiness, fuller than fullness, has come to inhabit us." -simone weil

"If I accept the fact that a god is absolute and beyond all human experiences, he leaves me cold. I do not affect him, nor does he affect me. But if I know that a god is a powerful impulse in my soul, at once I must concern myself with him, for then he can become important."~ Jung

"My child, he who listens must perceive the same as he who speaks, share his awareness; he must breathe together with him, share the same spirit; his hearing must be sharper than the voice of him who speaks" -the Asclepius

"The disciple might imagine that his teacher has some fixed knowledge. But the truth is that he, too, needs to keep finding what he knows: needs to keep discovering it freshly at every moment. The disciple's job is actually to learn to share this process, to develop the same awareness.
[...] Each instruction here is a whole teaching in itself. It is not just a matter of the disciple listening to the teacher's words. He must listen 'through' the teacher's words, beyond them. He has to try and connect directly with that silent source from which the teacher himself derives his wisdom. He needs to be reading between the lines, listening to the silence between the words, alert for the subtlest hint.
" -Peter Kingsley, An Introduction to the Hermetica

"All these things stood for something other than what they were, but all the same they were themselves bodily realities. And when the narrator mentioned them he was not employing figurative language, but giving an explicit account of things which had a forward reference that was figurative. So then the tree of life also was Christ... and indeed God did not wish the man to live in Paradise without the mysteries of spiritual things being presented to him in bodily form. So then in the other trees he was provided with nourishment, in this one with a sacrament... He is rightly called whatever came before him in order to signify him.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life#cite_note-12)" -St. Augustine

He argues on this side and on that. The acutest German, the lovingest disciple, could never tell what Platonism was; indeed, admirable texts can be quoted on both sides of every great question from him. [*(15)](https://emersoncentral.com/texts/representative-men/notes/#15)

When we say, Here is a fine collection of fables; or when we praise the style, or the common sense, or arithmetic, we speak as boys, and much of our impatient criticism of the dialectic, I suspect, is no better.


Our faculties run out into infinity, and return to us thence. We can define but a little way; but here is a fact which will not be skipped, and which to shut our eyes upon is suicide. All things are in a scale; and, begin where we will, ascend and ascend. All things are symbolical; and what we call results are beginnings."

He has reason, as all the philosophic and poetic class have: but he has also what they have not,- this strong solving sense to reconcile his poetry with the appearances of the world, and build a bridge from the streets of cities to the Atlantis.

In him the freest abandonment is united with the precision of a geometer.

Every great artist has been such by synthesis. Our strength is transitional, alternating; or, shall I say, a thread of two strands. The sea-shore, sea seen from shore, shore seen from sea; the taste of two metals in contact; and our enlarged powers at the approach and at the departure of a friend; the experience of poetic creativeness, which is not found in staying at home, nor yet in traveling, but in transitions from one to the other, which must therefore be adroitly managed to present as much transitional surface as possible; this command of two elements must explain the power and the charm of Plato. Art expresses the one or the same by the different. Thought seeks to know unity in unity; poetry to show it by variety; that is, always by an object or symbol. Plato keeps the two vases, one of aether and one of pigment, at his side, and invariably uses both

If speculation tends thus to a terrific unity, in which all things are absorbed, action tends directly backwards to diversity. The first is the course or gravitation of mind; the second is the power of nature. Nature is the manifold. The unity absorbs, and melts or reduces. Nature opens and creates. These two principles reappear and interpenetrate all things, all thought; the one, the many. One is being; the other, intellect: one is necessity; the other, freedom: one, rest; the other, motion: one, power; the other, distribution: one, strength; the other, pleasure: one, consciousness; the other, definition: one, genius; the other, talent: one, earnestness; the other, knowledge: one, possession; the other, trade: one, caste; the other, culture: one, king; the other, democracy: and, if we dare carry these generalizations a step higher, and name the last tendency of both, we might say, that the end of the one is escape from organization,- pure science; and the end of the other is the highest instrumentality, or use of means, or executive deity. -Emmerson Plato or the Philosopher

When we are praising Plato, it seems we are praising quotations from Solon and Sophron and Philolaus. Be it so. Every book is a quotation; and every house is a quotation out of all forests and mines and stone quarries; and every man is a quotation from all his ancestors.

**Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832),** an eminent German writer, whose views on science and nature inspired Emerson, and played into his first book, _Nature_.  Goethe had written “Every natural form to the smallest, a leaf, a sunbeam, a moment of time, a drop, is related to the whole, and partakes of the beauty of the whole.”  Emerson wrote “Goethe teaches courage.”

Mary sought knowledge, as she wrote in her journal, “without any of the bridges”.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Moody_Emerson#cite_note-18)   She stated, “How futile are creeds of faith & formulas of worship—the infinite stirs within—surrounds—absorbs”.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Moody_Emerson#cite_note-46)  Allowing finally that Ralph Waldo Emerson's heresy did not signify his assured damnation, Mary Emerson hoped that her nephew had found his own "[a]ngel who [could] best unite him to the Infinite".[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Moody_Emerson#cite_note-58)

Ralph Waldo Emerson’s Aunt Mary Moody Emerson exerted a powerful influence on him from his days as a youth.  She was self-educated, widely read and described by her nephew as “the best writer in Massachusetts.” She exhorted her nephews to “always do what you are afraid to do,” and by her insistence set standards for their intellectual growth. Emerson copied out some of her letters into four substantial notebooks later in his life and constantly referred back to her maxims and her influence.

The unity of Asia and the detail of Europe; the infinitude of the Asiatic soul and the defining, result-loving, machine-making, surface-seeking, opera-going Europe,—Plato came to join, and, by contact, to enhance the energy of each. The excellence of Europe and Asia are in his brain…In short, a balanced soul was born, perceptive of the two elements…. A man who could see two sides of a thing was born.  
~ Emerson, _Representative Men_, ‘Plato; or, the Philosopher’ (CW 4:53-54)

There are not in the world at any one time more than a dozen persons who read and understand Plato, never enough to pay for an edition of his works; yet to every generation these come duly down, for the sake of those few persons, as if God brought them in his hand.  
~ Emerson, _Essays. 1st Series_, ‘Spiritual Laws’ (CW 2:154)

Aristotle Platonizes.  
~ Emerson, J 3.489 (1835)

I cannot recite, even thus rudely, laws of the intellect, without remembering that lofty and sequestered class who have been its prophets and oracles, the high-priesthood of the pure reason, the _Trismegisti_, the expounders of the principles of thought from age to age. When at long intervals we turn over their abstruse pages, wonderful seems the calm and grand air of these few, these great spiritual lords who have walked in the world,—these of the old religion,—dwelling in a worship which makes the sanctities of Christianity look _parvenues_ and popular; for “persuasion is in soul, but necessity is in intellect.” This band of grandees, Hermes, Heraclitus, Empedocles, Plato, Plotinus, Olympiodorus, Proclus, Synesius and the rest, have somewhat so vast in their logic, so primary in their thinking, that it seems antecedent to all the ordinary distinctions of rhetoric and literature, and to be at once poetry and music and dancing and astronomy and mathematics. I am present at the sowing of the seed of the world. With a geometry of sunbeams the soul lays the foundations of nature.  
~ Emerson, _Essays. 1st Series_, ‘Intellect’ (CW 2:345-346)

We cannot prove our faith by syllogisms. The argument refuses to form in the mind. A conclusion, an inference, a grand augury, is ever hovering, but attempt to ground it, and the reasons are all vanishing and inadequate.  You cannot make a written theory or demonstration of this as you can an orrery of the Copernican astronomy. It must be sacredly treated. Speak of the mount in the mount. Not by literature or theology, but only by rare integrity, by a man permeated and perfumed with airs of heaven, — with manliest or womanliest enduring love, — can the vision be clear to a use the most sublime. And hence the fact that in the minds of men the testimony of a few inspired souls has had such weight and penetration. You shall not say, “O my bishop, O my pastor, is there any resurrection? What do you think? Did Dr Channing believe that we should know each other? did Wesley? did Butler? did Fénelon?” What questions are these! Go read Milton, Shakspeare or any truly ideal poet. Read Plato, or any seer of the interior realities. Read St Augustine, Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant. Let any master simply recite to you the substantial laws of the intellect, and in the presence of the laws themselves you will never ask such primary-school questions.  
~ Emerson, _Letters and Social Aims_, ‘Immortality’ (CW 8: 346-347)

We have two needs. Being and Organization. See how much pains we take here in Plato’s dialogues to set in order the One Fact in two or three or four steps, and renew as oft as we can the pleasure, the eternal surprise of coming at the last fact, as children run up steps to jump down, or up a hill to coast down on sleds, or run far for one slide, or as we get fishing-tackle and go many miles to a watering-place to catch fish, and having caught one and learned the whole mystery, we still repeat the process for the same result, though perhaps the fish are thrown overboard at the last. The merchant plays the same game on ‘Change, the card-lover at whist, — and what else does the scholar? He knows how the poetry, he knows how the novel or the demonstration will affect him, —  no new result but the oldest of all, yet he still craves a new book and bathes himself anew with the plunge at the last. The young men here, this morning, who have tried all the six or seven things to be done, namely, the sail, the bowlingalley, the ride to Hull and to Cohasset, the bath, and the spyglass, they are in a rage just now to do something: these itching fingers, this short activity, these nerves, this plasticity or creativeness accompanies forever and ever the Profound Being.  
~ Emerson, J 6.5- 6 (1841)

as our Jewish Bible has implanted itself in the table-talk and household life of every man and woman in the European and American nations, so the writings of Plato have preoccupied every school of learning, every lover of thought, every church, every poet,—making it impossible to think, on certain levels, except through him. He stands between the truth and every man’s mind, and has almost impressed language and the primary forms of thought with his name and seal.  
~ Emerson, _Representative Men_, ‘Plato; or, the Philosopher’ (CW 4:44-45)



"Like your shadow, the nature of its existence is peculiar: it cannot exist without you casting it. Your orientation in relation to light informs the shape and character of your shadow.

THERE IS ANOTHER KIND OF LIGHT" -Darin Stephenson

##### “All things are metaphors.” - Goethe

"Thus a word or an image is symbolic when it implies something more than its obvious and immediate meaning. It has a wider “unconscious” aspect that is never precisely defined or fully explained. Nor can one hope to define or explain it." -Jung

“When the mind explores the symbol, it is led to ideas that lie beyond the reach of reason.” - Jung

“With tarot we begin to think symbolically. In the symbolic realm, things connect; tarot allows us to see those connections.” 

People say what we’re all seeking is a meaning for life. I don’t think that’s what we’re really seeking. I think that what we’re seeking is an experience of being alive so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonance within our innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive. - Joseph Campbell

When a contradiction is impossible to resolve except by a lie, then we know that it is really a door. -Simone Weil

[[Goethe]] once asked Hegel what the 'dialectic' is, and he responded very beautifully, almost therapeutically, "(it) is basically nothing but the regulated and methodically cultivated spirit of contradiction which is innate in every human being. - from Twitter

people come to therapy really for blessing. Not so much to fix what's broken, but to get what's broken blessed. -James Hillman

"Magic is a way of living. If one has done one's best to steer the chariot, and one then notices that a greater other is actually steering it, then magical operation takes place." -Carl Jung, The Red Book

The storytellers that I love—amazing as they are at parsing meaning from stories—assert in their own ways that there’s an irreverence to “using” stories to reinforce and affirm what you already (think you) know. Martin Shaw, for example, has said that if you think you know right away what a story means, you’re not letting it do it’s real work, which he describes as a sort of “open-heart surgery. -Jessica Dore

First the word, then the herb, then the knife. -Asclepias

To be a poet is to have a soul in which knowledge passes instantaneously into feeling, and feeling flashes back as a new organ of knowledge. - George Eliot

The work is of two types: one the sages kept secret for the intelligent people who might extract it by their contemplation & precise understanding. The second is delusions & vanities, made from operations which are all false.

- Zosimos of Panopolis

"Having harkened not to me but to the Word (_Logos_) it is wise to agree that all things are one" - Heraclitus

"Illness itself is one of those forms of experienc by which man arrives at the knowledge of God. As He says, "Sicknesses themselves are My servants, and are attached to My chosen friends." -al-Ghazali
