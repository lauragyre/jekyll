A Study of Hekate's Role in the Chaldean Oracles and Related Literature
by Sarah Illes Johnson

[[Platonism]]

This book also includes significant information on Hekate and theurgical practice.

"Each man performs his service to the Holy according to what he is, not accordign to what he is not; after all, the sacrifice must not surpass the proper measure of the worshipper." -Iamblichus

"It is essential that you do not regard these (dogs) before you are initiated in your body. For being earthly, difficult dogs, they are shamelss, and charming souls they constantly lead them away from the initiations." (dogs meaning chthonic daemones) 

As well as the World Soul, Hekate was regarded as a personal teacher of theurgists.

The Chaldean oracles give instructions for creating an eikon for her, using house lizards, wild rue, and myrrh, and incense, and completing the process under a crescent moon.
