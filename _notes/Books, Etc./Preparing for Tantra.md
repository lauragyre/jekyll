This book is about understanding the preperatory practices for Buddhist Tantra, especially from a psychological angle. While I'm not much of a Tantric practitioner, I'm inspired by this as a parallel path in many ways, and appreciate a lot of the traditional wisdom. I was curious to know what kind of practices are advised before (or as a foundation for) getting into the more "magical" stuff, and why. I've also been feeling a compulsion to [[Intentions for 2022|work more on spiritual discipline this year]], so I'm hoping to get some inspiration for practice structures. 

The book describes the purpose of preperatory exercises as threefold: purification, accumulation of merit, and surrender.

The author stresses that purification doesn't need to invovle a punitive concept of sin, it's more on an energetic level. However, the types of purification in approximate order (as I understand them) are basically:

1. clearing resistance to acknowledging the harm one has participated in, both causing and receiving
2. [[The Four Agreements|clearing distorted thinking]], especially related to emotionally charged issues
3. clearing the wrong view that "reality" is fundamentally solid and independently existing

Accumulation of merit means taking actions that may later blossom into benefits for ourselves and others (hopefully with a loose attitude toward those results). In a psychological sense, we may also accumulate the inspiration and other correct mental attitudes that will help us to stay motivated and engaged enough to succeed in difficult practices.

Surrender is a challenging concept in Buddhism, where it isn't necessarily considered surrender to some kind of god or even a guru. Lama Yeshe said to "trust your inner wisdom," the part of you that will continue making choices even if (maybe especially if) you have a sense that you're releasing control of your life.
