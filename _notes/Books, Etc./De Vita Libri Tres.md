A renaissance book about health for academics/melancholics/people ruled by Mercury and Saturn.

A remedy: Four ounces of chebulie myrobalans (the main ingredient of triphala), three ounces of rose sugar, and 1/2 - 1 ounce preserved ginger depending on season. Boil this in emblic (amla) honey and coat with seven leaves of gold. Take a bit ever day on an empty stomach four hours before dinner for at least a year. (According to Jeffrey Kuperman, these are Jovial ingredients.)
